# PlotExtractionJupyterNb
This notebook changes the HTML extractor of nbconvert such that it returns 
a dictionary that also contains the data of all the inline plots of a given 
notebook. This data can then be written to disc using the usual write 
functions as is demonstrated in an example in the notebook.
